The plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) is the key enabling technology in several sectors such as Smart City applications and initiatives all over the world. Objects used in daily life are being equipped with electronic devices and protocol suites in order to make them interconnected and connected to the Internet. In the smart city application several heterogeneous devices needs to be connected through the internet for communication. Smart city applications involves huge data to be collected from various traditional/smart sensors and interactive databases which needs to be classified and analyzed. The use of IoT opens up an avenue of providing low cost services for sole purpose of digitalization cities. Several services such as street lighting, waste management, and parking and traffic congestion control can be offered with the use of sensors network at real time. According to the inaugural IMD Smart City Index published by Swiss business school IMD and the Singapore University of Technology and Design states that Singapore is the smartest city in the world due to its data and the infrastructures used in urban settings that applies technology. Applications of smart cities includes smart airports, smart education, and AI powered safe cities. Hence, the importance of data emerged since the main applications of smart cities depend on data collection from various sensors.
